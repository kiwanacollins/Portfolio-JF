Objective:
Design a portfolio website that showcases the user's work and skills, incorporating modern web design principles, cool animations, and a toggle feature for dark and light modes. The website should have a technical aesthetic that appeals to a tech-savvy audience.

Key Features:

Responsive Design:

Ensure the website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Utilize a grid system for layout consistency.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle:

Implement a toggle switch that allows users to switch between dark and light modes.
Use JavaScript to dynamically change the CSS styles based on the selected mode.
Store user preferences in local storage to remember the last selected mode.
Cool Animations:

Integrate smooth animations for transitions between sections (e.g., fade-in effects, slide transitions).
Use CSS animations and JavaScript libraries (like GSAP or Anime.js) for enhanced visual effects.
Ensure animations are subtle and do not distract from the content.
Technical Aesthetic:

Use a color palette that reflects a modern, technical feel (e.g., dark grays, blues, and whites).
Choose fonts that are clean and easy to read, with a focus on sans-serif styles.
Incorporate design elements like code snippets, circuit patterns, or tech-related graphics.
Content Structure:

Home Section:

A brief introduction with a catchy tagline.
A background image or video that reflects the technical theme.
About Section:

A short biography highlighting skills, experience, and interests.
Include a professional photo and links to social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub).
Portfolio Section:

Showcase projects with images, descriptions, and links to live demos or repositories.
Use a grid layout to display projects attractively.
Skills Section:

A visual representation of skills (e.g., progress bars, pie charts).
Categorize skills into sections (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools).
Contact Section:

A contact form for inquiries.
Include additional contact information (email, phone number).
Technical Requirements:

HTML/CSS:

Use semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO.
Create a separate CSS file for styling, ensuring it includes styles for both dark and light modes.
JavaScript:

Implement the dark/light mode toggle functionality.
Use JavaScript for animations and interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling, form validation).
Frameworks/Libraries:

Consider using Bootstrap for responsive design and layout.
Optionally, integrate a JavaScript animation library for enhanced effects.
User Experience Considerations:

Ensure that the website is accessible, with appropriate contrast ratios and alt text for images.
Optimize loading times by minimizing the use of heavy graphics and scripts.
Test the website across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
Final Deliverables:

A fully functional portfolio website with the specified features and design elements.
Documentation on how to maintain and update the website.
A brief guide on how to add new projects or content in the future.
